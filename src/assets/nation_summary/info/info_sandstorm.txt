History:  The hive is formed from various invertebrate species united under the control of the hive, In order to survive the hive quickly assimilated or consumed every scrap of living mater in it's little pocket of the world, multiplying at unsustainable rates it continues to grow rapidly and quickly become a threat to anything around it.

All that moves is prey
All that resists will be culled
All that grows will be stripped from these lands until nothing remains but shifting sand.

Vehicle Design Theme: Sandy colored insectoid biological combat units, glowing orange/yellow sacks can be found on various weaponry, flotation, eyes, and orifices, with sometimes exposed red flesh.
Shaping is generally rugged and spiky sometimes exoskeletons can have a rib like support structure.
Foreign Policy: If it's too far away they don't care, if it's weak it is prey, if it it's strong then the hive will attack easier targets first but will still consider conflict if there is nothing around.
