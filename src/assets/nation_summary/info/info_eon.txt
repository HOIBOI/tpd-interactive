Hive relation scale: Category / Example forms / Auditory metaphor / Easy of relation score / Hive response,
Kin resonance / Crystal-based entities, Nanite intelligences, Non-organic synthetic minds / Polyharmonic Achords — smooth overlays, phase-synced pulses, self-replicating rhythms / 9–10 / Immediate affinity. Shared perception paradigms. Cooperation is natural. Considered extended family.

Neutral Chorus / Standard organics (humanoids, animals, aliens with biochemical cognition) / Urban Noise — irregular rhythms, organic dissonance, perceptual mismatch / 4–5 / Possible collaboration, but emotional mistranslation is frequent. Maintained at arm’s length. Tolerated but not trusted.

Dimensional Interference / Transdimensional organics, Eldritch-touched, corrupted post-organics / Torn Drone — asymmetrical frequencies, distorted harmonics, entropy-driven tone shifts / 0–1 / Total repulsion. These beings are perceived as corrupted code or virulent noise. Elimination or evasion is prioritized.

Soft Static / Pre-sentient life, simple machines, animal minds / Background Hum — ambient, non-threatening, semi-structured / 2–3 / Ignored unless necessary. Interference minimal. May be co-opted or shaped.

False Harmony / Mimics, AI pretending to be Hive-compatible, infected crystal entities /  Misaligned Chorus — superficially harmonic, internally hollow, unpredictably dissonant / 1–2 / Deep suspicion. They mimic kinship but lack true resonance. Often met with surgical caution or quiet deletion.
