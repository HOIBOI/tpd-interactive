Auldric Crown,
Ciaranhappy and Collot
Low meta, low tech (litterally wood and sails lol)
We have 6 designs currently with a few more on the way on my end, and I think Collot was cooking something up earlier too? dunno if he still is. Flags a draft and is kinda fugly too.
Government: Monarchy
Capital: Auldria
Colours Gold, black
Design summary: Engineless sailing ships, generally consistant with the late 17th-early 19th century. Wooden outer hulls but generally with internal armouring, so that they the ships arent completely useless. Weapons are almost always either simples or simple APS's, which fire solid shots. Spinclipping is used to achieve some aesthetic goals but there is minimal overlap of blocks.
Diplomatic policy: aggressive, with Auldria seeking to reclaim its lost empire, but we are hesitant to attack enemies from outside our historical lands.
Lore: (rough draft. yet to talk about this with collot. beta will be good oppurtunity to do so). The Long Tyranny is finally over. The Usurper-King Delais Vo-Buckle is atlast dead, and the royal house of Kanton sits the throne once more. Auldria was a rotting heap, brought to its knees by foreign enemies and succeeding states, pushed all the way back to its home isles. Once again shall we dominate the peninsula. The Humiliation is over. Once again shall all the south-east learn to fear the name of Auld. Long live King James! Long Live the Crown!
