🧭Sea Dogs Fellowship Lore Doc 1,
Summary:
The Sea Dogs Fellowship is a group of military factions that exert military control over a territory. The native territory of most of the SDF peoples is the Kalapawai’i Peninsula. 

The state itself is an anarchy, and citizens/residents can come and go as they please. The way the Sea Dogs maintain control is by subdividing control amongst dozens if not hundreds of captains and crews–all of which act mostly independent and split what bounties/resources they gain amongst themselves.

People obviously coalesce in places for economic and cultural gain, so some cities exist, but they are lawless in a legal sense. There are still laws, however they’re informal and upheld by the cultural values of the residents instead of a legal backbone. 

The Sea Dogs–primarily Myrie Hawthorne–exert control through their network of captains and independent forces by calling a “Congregation” (No connection to a religious term I’m going to mention in a sec). The things that keep the dogs and their independent captains together are religious/cultural cohesion and a desire for survival. Why do they collectively desire survival enough to bond culturally? Because people invaded hundreds of years ago.

Species/Races: 
Racial/Special Groups:
Centibri: Anthropomorphized Centipede species, intelligence equal to that of humans, and strength generally equal to that of humans. They have greater dexterity on land, but are absolutely horrible swimmers, given they originate from the Kalapawai’i savannahs. Around 55% of the population
Halo’e: “Foreigners,” people not native to the Kalapawai’i Peninsula. This encompasses literally any non-major species, but the primary ones are:
Humans (reference point): The “vanilla” species. High intelligence, low dexterity and strength. Around 30% of the population,
Mixed/Gamma type Sublimates: Unknown info (presumably human with extra qualities). Around 0.5% of the population,
Driders: Low intelligence, very high dexterity and strength. Around 3-4% of the population.,
Others: TBD (The rest of the population).,
Sergals: Around 8-9% of the population.

Culture: 
Culture Groups:
Pi’ala Make: Dominant culture/ethnicity in the fellowship. Practitioners of the religion Ala. Estimated percentage of population, probably around 70% (Majority of whom are Centibri and Human).
Others: TBD

Religion: 
Religions:
Ala Congregationalists (Ala’e): The religion values individual autonomy and a self-directed path to death. All facets of the culture focus on one's path unto death, and they very highly value honorable or “meaningful” deaths. This means that one of the worst fates an Ala’e (practitioner of the Ala faith) is to be suspended or prevented from reaching pure death. They believe heavily in the spirit and a spiritual connection with the body–something often “explored” with rum, as they believe the drowsy state of drunkenness is bringing oneself closer to their spiritual side. They believe that, upon death, they will wake up in a plane facing the “black mirror,” an important cultural artifact, which will dictate how they lived their lives and whether or not they can “die,” or if they will be rebirthed (the poor outcome for Ala’e). Estimated percentage of population, probably around 60% (same reasons/demographics as Pi’ala Make peoples).
Others: TBD

Other Lore/Info:
The Driders are a persecuted species, and have been taken advantage of for decades by Centibri and Halo’e species for manual labor. This manual labor is usually for quarrying and other strength-intensive factory jobs. Driders cannot be trusted with precision manual labor like mining or lumber, since they tend to destroy the resources, so those are most often done by human refugees for living wages (who pays the wages…?).
