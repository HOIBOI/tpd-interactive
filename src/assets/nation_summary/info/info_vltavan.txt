Vltavan Brotherhood

Team: bongomeister, sealpup

Faction lore: The oil-rich Vltavan islands have had a long history of conflict, ever since the first gun was jury-rigged to a raft. Many empires and dynasties have risen here, only to inevitably fall to enemies internal and external (Think China for literally all of its history lol)

For now, they are in control of the Vltavan Brotherhood, a militaristic, dangerous and hyper-nationalist dictatorship that prioritises Vltava above anything and everything else. (Think WW2 germany - i dont aim to glorify this btw, every action i take will PURELY be for rp reasons)

Despite the bellicose nature of its inhabitants, Vltava enjoyed a brief respite from violence after the formation of the democratic Rodina Republic some decades ago. This fledgling state had a genuine interest in improving the quality of life of the Vltavan people, and it's possible Vltava could have reversed its bloodthirsty fortunes if not for a full-scale Sector 7 invasion intent on claiming the Vltavan bounty in oil.

The Republic, unprepared for prolonged war, collapsed. This resulted in the rise of the hyper-militaristic Brotherhood, who were the only ones capable of defending Vltava in its hour of need. This culminated in the Battle of the Blockade, during which a secret fleet, built over 5 years by the Brotherhood to take advantage of new jet and hydrofoil technology, engaged the invading forces. The Brotherhood continued to remain in power, reasoning that to avoid any more Vltavan lives being threatened, they must militarily ensure that no other foreign nation would be able to threaten Vltava again.

Faction craft style: Medium meta; however, no energy weapons (except for railguns) are used. Very heavy reliance on speed and jet engines, most of a craft will be alloy. Heavy armour is used around turrets, critical areas, and for belt armour in very large ships. Designs are usually compact but heavily armoured.
