Umamusume Regional Accords,
A competitive society born out of an era where the fastest runners were those who were able to hunt and bring back food for tribes. In the open grasslands and plains of the home islands, where visibility was good, endurance and speed reigned supreme. 

As society and technology progressed and improved, quality of life rose, and the life-and-death need for speed declined. 

With the rise of regional governments and trade, different groups started competing to see who could run fastest and farthest. Thus, racing was established as a prestige sport, with great riches showered upon winners. Major winners are given names of ships in the navy as part of their honors, and the largest ships are named after major races based on their perimeter to spread the word.

The Umamusume Regional Accord has its roots in the Umamusume Racing Federation, an organization that was established to facilitate inter-regional races across the collection of islands and families that consisted of the area. As prestige of the races it hosted grew, so did its power, and with the signing of the Darley-Shadai Accords in the city of Shadai, the Umamusume Regional Accord was established, granting each major region a seat at a unified council, with its seat in the newly renamed capital city of Shadai-Tracen.
