Full Lore,
Diplomacy:,
Unwarranted attacks will be met by a disproportionate response, usually including nuclear weapons,
Mostly Anti-War/Survivalistic, would rather just be left alone outside alliances or trade pacts,
Unlikely to attack people for any reason (you gotta really deserve it),
All Official messages and transmissions arrive in rhyme and poems (scrapped, I cannot be bothered and I think someone else is doing it anyways),
Slight distrust of organics (see history),
Population:,
When under peace the individual units make up a vast amount of robotic individuals who generally have self awareness and are capable of doing things on their own,
At war, all individuals are called into the full scale unified intelligence where ALL actions are controlled by what effectively just became a nationwide cloud computer,
The greater intelligence outside of war generally makes up the government and as such still is functionally and diplomatically a 'hivemind',
Not much different than organics, money flows (except during war), though personal relations between units don't really form since there is no purpose to such beside simple friendships.,
Home Territory:,
Capital: Front of the Decaying Nucleus
Land: A large singular island, whose land is quite irradiated. Tough living conditions for organics, though trade ports are particularly clean (at least the parts foreign individuals have access to)
Nuclear Doctrine:,
[Redacted],
Expansion Tendencies,

Past History (tldr),
Was once a very advanced nation with the ability to create sapient robots and had a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, however mistreatment of the AI caused it to fully combine into a single consciousness and initiate a full scale seizer of nearly all nuclear weapons, and what followed was a mass exchange limited to a singleish continent between man and machine. The machine won, I am that machine. Few of the original warheads survived the exchange, with a small portion left to research by the intelligence, only recently has the technological advances, and more importantly resources to make them, once again discovered. The mass exchange was ~100 years ago with much of the short lived elements gone, however a lingering radiation is left in the soil.

In a long term attempt to find purpose and self, the machine created individual separated consciousnesses in a vague attempt to replicate it's former masters behaviors and traditions. 

The nation is now ready to join the world scene for the first time.
